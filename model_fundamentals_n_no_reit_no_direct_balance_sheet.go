	CurrentDeferredRevenue *float32 `json:"current_deferred_revenue,omitempty"`
	// <p>{{CurrentDeferredTaxesLiabilities}} means a future tax liability, resulting from temporary differences between book (accounting) value of assets and liabilities and their tax value, or timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation.

	// <p>A {{Goodwill}} is an {{Intangibles}} that arises as a result of the acquisition of one company by another for a premium value. The value of a company's brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations and any patents or proprietary technology represent {{Goodwill}}. {{Goodwill}} is considered an {{Intangibles}} because it is not a physical asset like buildings or equipment. The {{Goodwill}} account can be found in the assets portion of a company's balance sheet.</p>

	// <p>Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are the fixed assets of the companyFixed assets are also known as non-current assets. Property, Plant and Equipment includes assets that will - in the normal course of business - neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers. Some of the most common parts of Property, Plant and Equipment are: Land, Buildings (and leasehold improvements), Transportation equipment, Manufacturing equipment, Office equipment, Office furniture. Companies with lots of Property, Plant and Equipment often have special categories. For example, railroad property includes: Track, Ties, Ballast, Bridges, Tunnels, Signals, Locomotives, Freight Cars. There is often a note in the financial statements - found in a company's 10-K - that will explain the different categories of property a company owns. <br>The market value of Property, Plant and Equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of Property, Plant and Equipment. For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company's manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment  away. That property, plant, and equipment was literally worth less than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres of land. All Property, Plant and Equipment other than land is depreciated. Land is never depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either. Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown on the balance sheet at cost. <br>The Property, Plant and Equipment line shown on the balance sheet is {{GrossPPE}}. This means it is the cost of the property, plant, and equipment not less accumulated depreciation.</p>
	GrossPpe *float32 `json:"gross_ppe,omitempty"`
	// <p>{{Intangibles}} are defined as identifiable non-monetary assets that cannot be seen, touched or physically measured.  Examples of {{Intangibles}} include trade secrets, copyrights, patents, trademarks. If a company acquires assets at the prices above the book value, it may carry {{Goodwill}} on its balance sheet. {{Goodwill}} reflects the difference between the price the company paid and the book value of the assets. If a company (company A) received a patent through their own work, though it has value, it does not show up on its balance sheet as an intangible asset. However, if company A sells this patent to company B, it will show up on company B's balance sheet as an {{Intangibles}}. The same applies to brand names, trade secrets etc. For instance, Coca-Cola's brand is extremely valuable, but the brand does not appear on its balance sheet, because the brand was never acquired.</p>

	// <p>{{LongTermDebt}} is the debt due more than 12 months in the future. The debt can be owed to banks or bondholders. Some companies issue bonds to investors and pay interest on the bonds. <br>{{LongTermCapitalLeaseObligation}} represents the total liability for long-term leases lasting over one year. It's amount equal to the present value (the principal) at the beginning of the lease term less lease payments during the lease term. <br>{{Long-Term_Debt}} can be used to calculate {{ltd2asset}}: {{ltd2asset}} = {{Long-Term_Debt}} / {{Total_Assets}}</p>

	// <p>Technically, {{Other_Current_Assets}} line may include any asset that will be used up within the next 12 months. However, {{Other_Current_Assets}} never include assets that are listed elsewhere in the current assets section of the balance sheet. For this reason, {{Other_Current_Assets}} are almost never: Cash, Trade Receivables, {{Inventory}}. The assets grouped under {{Other_Current_Assets}} are most commonly: Prepaid Expenses, Tax Assets, Non-Trade Receivables, Other (too numerous to list). Some companies can and do choose to report each of these items separately. {{Other_Current_Assets}} may be made up largely of Prepaid Expenses - unless these are listed on a separate line of the balance sheet. <br>There are a variety of {{Other_Current_Assets}} like non-trade receivables which are simply too numerous to list. If a company is following correct reporting procedures, it should not lump items that are different from one another and yet individually important to the company together under the line {{Other_Current_Assets}}. <br>At most companies, {{Other_Current_Assets}} are a small and unimportant part of the total balance sheet.</p>
	OtherCurrentAssets *float32 `json:"other_current_assets,omitempty"`

	// <p>{{Preferred_Stock}} is a special equity security that has properties of both equity and debt. It is generally considered a hybrid instrument. {{Preferred_Stock}} is senior to {{CommonStock}}, but is subordinate to bonds in terms of claim or rights to their share of the assets of the company. {{Preferred_Stock}} has priority over {{CommonStock}} in the payment of dividends and any payments received when a company liquidates. <br>{{Preferred_Stock}} comes in many forms. It can be: Convertible or Non-Convertible, Cumulative or Non-Cumulative, Voting or Non-Voting, Callable or Non-Callable, Maturity Date or No Maturity Date. <br>A {{Preferred_Stock}} without a maturity date is called a perpetual preferred stock. These are relatively rare. A good example of perpetual {{Preferred_Stock}} is the many series of Public Storage (PSA) preferred shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange. <br>Before investing in preferred stock, it is important to know which of the above groups the stock belongs to. Is it convertible or non-convertible? Are dividends cumulative or non-cumulative? It is also critical that an investor knows what bonds the company has in front of the {{Preferred_Stock}}. Bondholders get paid first. So the decision to buy a {{Preferred_Stock}} can be similar to the decision to buy a bond. But, remember, the {{Preferred_Stock}} of a company with bonds is junior to those bonds.  <br>Unless a {{Preferred_Stock}} is convertible, the upside in a preferred stock investment is more limited than in a {{CommonStock}} investment. If a company doubles its earnings, it is usually under no more obligation to double the dividends paid to preferred shareholders than it is to double the interest paid to its bankers and bondholders.So {{Preferred_Stock}} is very different from {{CommonStock}}.</p>

	RawMaterials *float32 `json:"raw_materials,omitempty"`
	// <p>{{Retained_Earnings}} is the accumulated portion of {{Net_Income}} that is not distributed to shareholders. Because the {{Net_Income}} was not distributed to shareholders, shareholders' equity is increased by the same amount. Of course, if a company loses, it is called retained losses, or accumulated losses. Historically profitable companies sometimes have negative {{Retained_Earnings}}. This is because they have cumulatively paid out more to shareholders than they reported in profits. If a company has negative {{Retained_Earnings}}, investors should check the 10-year financial results. They should not assume that negative {{Retained_Earnings}} prove a company has generally lost money in the past. Of course, many companies with negative {{Retained_Earnings}} have indeed lost money in the past.</p>
