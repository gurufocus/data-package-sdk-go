            \ Land, Buildings (and leasehold improvements), Transportation equipment,\
            \ Manufacturing equipment, Office equipment, Office furniture. Companies\
            \ with lots of property, plant, and equipment often have special categories.\
            \ For example, railroad property includes: Track, Ties, Ballast, Bridges,\
            \ Tunnels, Signals, Locomotives, Freight Cars. There is often a note in\
            \ the financial statements - found in a company's 10-K - that will explain\
            \ the different categories of property a company owns. <br>The market\
            \ value of {{Net_PPE}} can differ tremendously from the book value of\
            \ {{Net_PPE}}. For example, when Berkshire Hathaway liquidated its textile\
            \ mills, it had to pay the buyers of the company's manufacturing equipment\
            \ to haul the equipment  away. That {{Net_PPE}} was literally worth less\
            \ than zero. On the other hand, some companies own thousands of acres\
            \ of land. All {{Net_PPE}} other than land is depreciated. Land is never\
            \ depreciated. However, land is not marked up to market value either.\
            \ Under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), land is shown\
            \ on the balance sheet at cost. <br>The {{Net_PPE}} line shown on the\
            \ balance sheet is usually net {{Net_PPE}}. This means it is the cost\
            \ of the {{Net_PPE}} less accumulated depreciation.</p>"

            \ or Non-Voting, Callable or Non-Callable, Maturity Date or No Maturity\

            \ groups the stock belongs to. Is it convertible or non-convertible? Are\

            What is E10? How do we calculate E10?\r\n\r\nE10 is the average of the\
            \ inflation adjusted earnings of a company over the past 10 years. Let™\
            s use an example to explain. \r\n\r\nIf we want to calculate the E10 of\
            \ Wal-Mart (WMT) for Dec. 31, 2010, we need to have the inflation data\
            \ and the earnings from 2001 through 2010. \r\n\r\nWe adjusted the earnings\
            \ of 2001 earnings data with the total inflation from 2001 through 2010\
            \ to the equivalent earnings in 2010. If the total inflation from 2001\

            s equivalent earnings in 2010 is $1.4 a share. If Wal-Mart earns $1 again\
            \ in 2002, and the total inflation from 2002 through 2010 is 35%, then\
            \ the equivalent 2002 earnings in 2010 is $1.35. So on and so forth, you\
            \ get the equivalent earnings of past 10 years. Then you add them together\
            \ and divided the sum by 10 to get E10."

          description: |-
            In 1986 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter, Warren Buffett defined owner earnings as follows:

            "These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports. These numbers routinely include (a) plus (b) - but do not subtract (c)."

            "These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports.

            "These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports.

(If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports.

            "These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports.

            "These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports.

            "These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges...less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume. (If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be included in (c))...Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes - both for investors in buying stocks and for managers in buying entire businesses...All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports.
